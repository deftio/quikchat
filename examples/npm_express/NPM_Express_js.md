#  Express_js with NPM

This directory contains a simple nodejs based sample which demonstrates how to use quikchat by installing from npm.

## setup
First create a new project in directory and copy the files in this folder (only the files in npm_express folder).

Then in that directory run:

```bash
npm init
npm install quikchat expressjs
```

## running demo

Now run the a local server using express.js:

```bash
node server.cjs
```

Now navigate to browser (http://localhost:3000) and the widget should be running.
