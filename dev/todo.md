## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Scalability Limits & Recommendations

### Current Performance Ceilings
- **Good until**: ~200-500 messages, ~10 concurrent users, desktop-focused
- **Breaks at**: 1000+ messages (DOM bloat), large conversations, mobile usage
- **Document size**: Works well under 50KB of chat history
- **Migration path**: Abstract interfaces NOW to make future swapping easier

### Recommended Usage Limits (for production)
- Max 500 messages per conversation
- Max 50KB document/history size  
- Desktop-first (mobile as secondary)
- Set explicit user expectations about limits

### Architecture Recommendations
1. **Keep data model separate** from QuikChat implementation
2. **Abstract the chat interface** to allow future library swaps
3. **Plan for migration** when you hit 100+ active users
4. **Consider bundling** - Tree-shaking could reduce size significantly

## üìù Developer Feedback Notes

### Where QuikChat Shines

- Zero dependencies is genuinely impressive - no framework lock-in
- Simple mental model - just messages in a container
- Streaming support works well for LLM use cases
- History export/import is well-thought-out

### Current Limitations 

- No virtual scrolling - Will struggle with 1000+ messages (DOM bloat)
- No message diffing - Full re-renders on updates
- Limited extensibility - Can't inject custom components (reactions, embeds, etc.)
- No accessibility - Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- No i18n - Hardcoded strings, no RTL support
- Security concerns - innerHTML usage without sanitization hooks

### Comparison to Alternatives 

- vs stream-chat-react: QuikChat is 100x simpler but 10x less capable
- vs ChatUI libraries: Lacks message threading, typing indicators, read receipts
- vs Custom React/Vue: QuikChat wins on simplicity, loses on everything else

### Verdict 

Perfect for prototypes, concerning for production at scale - addressing accessibility, performance, and security would make it production-ready while maintaining simplicity advantage.
